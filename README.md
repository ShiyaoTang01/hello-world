## something about myself
I am a U2 undergraduate student at McGill university pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Statistics and minor in Interdisciplinary Life Sciences. I am from Nanjing, China and I finished my high school degree there. Through my high school study, I have developed a strong interest in life sciences and started to learn university-level biology by myself, and my efforts were paid off by winning the first prize of High School Biology Olympiad.
With further study in university, I wish I can use quantitative methods and statistical applications to help with biological and clinical problems. I am interested in developing statistical models, data analysis, and interdisciplinary statistical applications.
