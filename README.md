## something about myself
I am a MSc year1 graduate student at McGill university pursuing a Master degree in Biotatistics. I finished my undergraduates in McGill University as well. I am from Nanjing, China. 
With further study in university, I wish I can use quantitative methods and statistical applications to help with biological and clinical problems. I am interested in developing statistical models, data analysis, and interdisciplinary statistical applications. Recently I've nominated my supervisor Dr. Robert Platt and I will be writing a thesis under his supervision, aiming in developing machine learning methods in transportability in casual inference.
I'm not quite a person good at coding. But I always challenge myself out of my comfort zone, and that's why I'm here!
